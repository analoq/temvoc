Temporal Vocoder
================

The Temporal Vocoder is an audio effect for sound designers.  It takes a
carrier input and reconstructs it using tiny pieces from the modulator input.
The result is an approximation of the carrier input with characteristics of the
modulator.

Uses the kiss_fft library:
